Approach

I thought about using tries - suffix tries. I spent some time thinking about it. Then I tried a simple brute force approach. This seems to work. The first run I had took approximately 4.9 seconds to run

-----------------------------------
First add ruby prof
Some optimizations I could think of are
1. find out the minimum word length so that we can avoid empty recursions 
2. parallelize the search for suffix matches
3. parallelize word search itself using - subsetted hash maps or an array that uses binary search to find

-------------------------------
backpocket answer in python ? or perl ? or java ?


==============
Benchmarks with hash implementation
vijay@localhost:~/tests/word-substring$ rspec spec/word_matcher_spec.rb -l 71
Run options: include {:line_numbers=>[71]}
       user     system      total        real
   4.900000   0.020000   4.920000 (  4.908990)
